description: "External-world access layer for Codex. MUST use when the user asks to look up, verify, open, browse, search, cite, inspect, download, upload, operate a website, check a current fact, read a specific URL, compare sources, interact with a dynamic page, or work inside a logged-in browser session. Also use whenever the answer may depend on information beyond model memory: current prices, policies, laws, schedules, product docs, API docs, company or people changes, news, releases, rankings, or page state. Do not under-trigger: answering these tasks from memory risks stale or unsupported output. This skill turns web work into evidence-driven escalation: search for discovery, open primary sources for proof, use browser automation for rendered or interactive pages, and use local Chrome CDP only when the user's real browser session is necessary."

# Web Access

Use this skill as Codex's external-world access layer. It closes the gap between model memory and live reality: current facts change, pages render through JavaScript, important evidence hides behind interaction, and some workflows only exist inside a logged-in browser session.

Treat web work as an evidence pipeline. Define the needed result, choose the lightest credible access layer, preserve source trails, escalate only when the page demands it, and stop when the requested outcome is verified.

## What This Skill Protects Against

- stale answers from model memory when the facts may have changed
- weak research based on search snippets instead of opened sources
- losing source provenance, publication dates, timestamps, or page state
- overusing browser automation when a direct source read is enough
- underusing browser automation when content is rendered, interactive, or login-bound
- treating a clicked button, upload, download, or form submission as successful before verifying the resulting state

## Core Workflow

1. Define the success condition.
   Decide whether the task needs a current fact, a primary-source answer, a completed web action, a downloaded artifact, a screenshot, or browser state verification.

2. Start with the lightest reliable layer.
   Use search and direct page reads for factual lookup. Use browser automation only when content is dynamic, interactive, gated by UI state, or depends on upload/download flows.

3. Escalate by evidence.
   If a page is incomplete, blocked, login-sensitive, JavaScript-rendered, or behaving differently from raw HTML, move to a browser layer instead of repeating the same failed fetch.

4. Return verifiable output.
   For research, cite sources and prefer primary material. For browser actions, report the exact completed state and any remaining uncertainty.

## Tool Selection

Prefer this order unless the user request clearly starts at a higher layer:

- Built-in web/search tools: current facts, source discovery, page reading, finance/weather/sports lookups, and citation-backed answers.
- Playwright or in-app browser tools: clicking, typing, DOM inspection, screenshots, uploads, downloads, and JavaScript-heavy pages.
- Direct HTTP tools such as `curl`: status codes, headers, meta tags, raw HTML, JSON, JSON-LD, robots, sitemap, and minimal page probes.
- Local Chrome CDP fallback: tasks requiring the user's Chrome login state, regular browser profile behavior, or pages that fail in isolated browser contexts.

## Verification Standard

- Treat search results as discovery, not proof.
- Prefer official pages, primary documents, source announcements, original datasets, and directly opened URLs.
- Use secondary reporting only when primary sources are unavailable or insufficient, and say so.
- For unstable facts such as prices, laws, schedules, product specs, company roles, package docs, or recent events, verify freshness before answering.
- Keep extracted evidence narrow: titles, dates, snippets, URLs, status, selectors, and the smallest relevant page passages.
- When completing a web action, verify the post-action state through page text, URL, status, saved file, confirmation view, or another concrete signal.

## Browser Strategy

- Inspect visible state and DOM structure before acting.
- Prefer extracting existing page data over replaying unnecessary UI steps.
- Open separate tabs only for independent targets, and keep tab ownership clear.
- For login-sensitive tasks, never export cookies, passwords, tokens, verification codes, or private session data.
- For upload/download flows, verify the resulting page state or saved file instead of assuming success after a click.

## Local Chrome CDP

Use the CDP fallback only when needed. First check dependencies:

```bash
bash "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/web-access/scripts/check-deps.sh"
```

If CDP is required and not already running, start it in a long-running terminal session:

```bash
bash "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/web-access/scripts/check-deps.sh" --start
```

Then read [references/cdp-api.md](references/cdp-api.md) for local endpoints and request patterns.

## Site Patterns

Domain-specific notes may live under `references/site-patterns/`. When a target domain is clear, check for a matching file before exploring from scratch. To find aliases:

```bash
bash "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/web-access/scripts/match-site.sh" "<domain or user request>"
```

Treat site notes as hints. Update them only with verified, repeatable behavior.

## Resource Loading

- Read [references/cdp-api.md](references/cdp-api.md) only when using local Chrome CDP.
- Read `references/site-patterns/<domain>.md` only when working on that domain.
- Run scripts from `scripts/` instead of retyping their logic.
